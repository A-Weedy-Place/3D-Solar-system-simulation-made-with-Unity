# Solar System Simulation – Unity Project

This is a 3D simulation of the Earth's solar system developed in Unity.

## 🌌 Features

- The simulation includes:
  - The Sun
  - Mercury, Venus, Earth (with Moon), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto
- All planetary sizes are set to their real-world scale ratios.
- Orbital speeds are adjusted to be a close approximation of actual planetary velocities.
- Each planet uses a unique texture to visually distinguish it from the others.

## 🎥 Cameras

- A main camera allows the user to click on any celestial body (Sun, Moon, or a planet) and follow it.
- By default, the view is locked to the Sun, but it can be switched to any other body.
- The simulation also includes a 2D top-down minimap of the solar system in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

## ☄️ Additional Elements

- Randomly generated comets fly through space at various time intervals and from random directions.
- Each planet has its own associated sound effects for enhanced immersion.
